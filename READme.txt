 This script was written in Porteus5.0 can also be used in Porteus5.01; its the
 same shit!, for some reason Porteus5.01 has some ice shit in the firmware intel
 directory [/lib/firmware/intel]. Try it out! its a cool-script to get the bluetooth working,
 since Porteus runs in RAM your system wont get fucked with. Just change the uuid in the script
 for YOUR drive that your using to boot up Porteus, or just examine the shell/bash script its easy to fallow. the firmware that was missing was ibt-17-16-1.sfi/ddc so it can work on my system.
